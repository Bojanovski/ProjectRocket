The idea was to create a physics engine in JavaScript using p5 library and create a rocket / neural network with it. The rocket/ANN is composed of a nodes and links that serve as, both, forward pass for the ANN and to represent the physical structure of the rocket. Learning is performed with a genetic algorithm.
